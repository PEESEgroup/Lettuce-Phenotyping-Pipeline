`data_capture.py`: This script interfaces with the imaging hardware to capture `RGB` and `DEPTH` images of lettuce samples. It automates the data acquisition process by configuring camera settings, synchronizing `RGB` and `DEPTH` captures, and saving the images with filenames that include the date and time of capture (e.g., `image_2024-03-27 14_19_56.png` and `depthimg_2024-03-27 14_19_56.png`) in an organized format for further analysis.
