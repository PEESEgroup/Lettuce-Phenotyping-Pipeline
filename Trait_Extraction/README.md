`trait_extraction.py`: This script processes RGB and depth image datasets to extract geometric parameters, including length, width, max_z (distance from camera to the bottom of the lettuce), and min_z (distance from camera to the top of the lettuce). 

`compute_traits.ipynb`: This notebook computes plant traits such as height, area, and volume from the extracted geometric parameters: length, width, max_z, and min_z.
